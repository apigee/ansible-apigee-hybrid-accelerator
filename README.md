# Ansible playbooks to deploy Apigee Hybrid using Helm Charts

[![E2E Testing](https://github.com/apigee/ansible-apigee-hybrid-accelerator/actions/workflows/testing.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/apigee/ansible-apigee-hybrid-accelerator/actions/workflows/testing.yml)

This repository contains a set of Ansible roles and playbooks to manage the installation, configuration and maintenance of Apigee Hybrid in your environment. Apigee Hybrid components are managed using helm charts through ansible roles.Apigee Hybrid combines the power of Apigee's API management with the flexibility and control of Kubernetes. With this playbooks, you can automate common Apigee Hybrid management tasks, making it easier to deploy, configure, and maintain your Apigee Hybrid clusters.


> Refer the [official doc](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/hybrid/preview/helm-install) for more details on Helm charts for Apigee Hybrid.

## Ansible Apigee Hybrid Accelerator Features
The Ansible playbooks in this repository support a wide range of the installation, configuration and maintenance use cases that are necessary to successfully manage Apigee Hybrid clusters. We describe the uses cases that are supported as follows:

| Feature Name | Feature Description |
| --- | --- |
| Single Region Deployment | Apigee Hybrid single region deployment|
| Multi-Region Deployment | Apigee Hybrid Multi region deployment|
| DC Decomission | Apigee Hybrid single or all region/DC decommission  |
| Apigee Hybrid Component management | Apigee Hybrid component configuration/re-configuration/decommission. |

### Configure Ansible Variables

Before using the Ansible playbooks you need to configure the necessary variables. 
Modify the variable files located in the [vars](./vars) directory to match your environment.

Refer [Example Vars](vars/vars.yaml)

## Ansible tags
The playbook exposes tags to selectively run tasks depending on the need.

Below are the tags that are exposed in the playbook

Ansible tag | Functionality

## Authenticate gcloud and helm

### Authenticate to gcloud cli as shown below
> Ensure the Authenticating user OR service account has `roles/apigee.admin` role.

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### [Optional] Authenticate to helm registry if using self hosted or private registry

```
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token | helm registry login -u oauth2accesstoken \
--password-stdin https://<artifact-registry-region>-docker.pkg.dev
```

## Usage

Below are some of the usage patterns.

### Primary DC  Installation Only

To deploy Apigee Hybrid in 1 Region only run the ansible playbook as shown below

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -e @vars/vars.yaml  --tags "dc1"
```

### Primary & Secondary DC  Installation Only

To deploy Apigee Hybrid in 2 Regions run the ansible playbook as shown below

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -e @vars/vars.yaml
```

### Decommission Primary DC  Only

To decommission Apigee Hybrid in the first region run the ansible playbook as shown below

```
ansible-playbook decommission.yaml -e @vars/vars.yaml --tags dc1
```

### Decommission Primary & Secondary DC  

To decommission Apigee Hybrid from both Regions run the ansible playbook as shown below

```
ansible-playbook decommission.yaml -e @vars/vars.yaml
```

### Apigee Hybrid Component management
To manage components via playbook you need to run playbook while passing the selective ansible tag.Some scenarios are listed below

#### Validate the provided inputs
To validate the inputs given to ansible
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -e @vars/vars.yaml  --tags "validate-input" 
```

#### Validate the current setup
To validate a running setup by executing mock APIs.
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -e @vars/vars.yaml  --tags "validate"
```

#### To Update Apigee VirtualHost
To update the Apigee Virtual Hosts.
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -e @vars/vars.yaml  --tags "validate-input,generte-overrides,apigee-virtualhost,wait_virtualhost,validate"
```

#### Cassandra Custom Storage Classes
To use custom storage classes for cassandra statefulsets, you can populate the `storageClass` parameter in the vars file that you are using. By defining a custom storage class, it will first be created in your cluster and then set as the storage class of the cassandra statefulsets. You will also need to specify the `provisionerType` and the `parameters`. You can use the following provisioners:
- gke 
- aks
- eks
- anthos-vsphere-csi
*Note: If you face any issues with any of the provisioners, please create a github issue in this repository*

#### To update cert-manager

To update cert-manager, follow these steps:

1. Specify the version in the vars.yaml file:
    Modify the cert_manager_version variable in the vars/vars.yaml file to the desired version. For example:
```
cert_manager_version: v1.14.0
```

Run the Ansible playbook:
Execute the Ansible playbook which includes the logic to check the current version of cert-manager, compare it with the specified version, and update if necessary.
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -e @vars/vars.yaml --tags "cert-manager"
```
The playbook will:

- Check the currently installed version of cert-manager.
- Compare it with the version specified in the vars.yaml file.
- If the versions differ, the playbook will download and apply the new cert-manager manifest.
- If the versions are the same and cert-manager is running, no action will be taken.
- If cert-manager is not installed, the playbook will install it using the specified version.
